                  <p>The journey of the 'Institute of Information and Communication 
                    Technology (IICT)' was started from 2002, when the honorable 
                    Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina awarded a project of amount of 
                    3 crore BDT for a Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) program. 
                    That time it was conducted by the Computer Science and 
                    Engineering Department of Shahjalal University of Science
                     and Technology. That project was done very successfully 
                     and about 180 students were graduated from this diploma program 
                     and in return IICT was approved by the university, UGC and
                      funded by the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Bangladesh.
                     We are pleased to announce the establishment of the IICT, the first Institute of 

                    Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in 2007 to address the mandate
                   of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. The main objective of the
                  institute is to promote and provide facilities for diploma, undergraduate 
                 and post graduate study in the field of ICT to create future leaders and 
                    entrepreneurs who can accelerate progress in information and technology 
                      by exploring new dimensions to represent Bangladesh in global platforms.
                       To fulfill our goal, IICT is pursuing active research in the field of ICT
                      to develop knowledge-based products and services. The institute will also 
              develop ICT facilities in order to create an on-campus environment conductive to enthusiasm,
                innovation, and enterprise and to nurture innovative ideas and incubate promising initiatives. 
                At the same time the institute will try to produce manpower and expertise in ICT by carrying out training in diverse areas 
                for those interested in taking ICT as a profession as well as those who are already 
                engaged in the profession. The institute will also provide consulting and advisory services 
                to public and private organizations.</p>
